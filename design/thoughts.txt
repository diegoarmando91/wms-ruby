Inventory model should be POLYMORPHIC - such that locations, staging locations, dock doors and containers are all different tables. Maybe the location_type in the table container table can have a polymorphic location attribute.
Single Table Inheritance:
	Useful for UOMs (Quantity, Volume, Length, Mass, etc.)
	Useful for Replenishment locations (just one kind of subclassed object called ReplenishmentLocation
	Useful for differente Assignment Types (Putaway, Cycle Counting, Picking, Loading, etc.)
