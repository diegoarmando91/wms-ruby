Inventory model should be POLYMORPHIC - such that locations, staging locations, dock doors and containers are all different tables. Maybe the location_type in the table container table can have a polymorphic location attribute.
Single Table Inheritance:
	Useful for UOMs (Quantity, Volume, Length, Mass, etc.)
	Useful for Replenishment locations (just one kind of subclassed object called ReplenishmentLocation
	Useful for differente Assignment Types (Putaway, Cycle Counting, Picking, Loading, etc.)
Singleton approach for the LocationFinder engine and Allocation engine.  Will need to manage queues (could also be separate classes) to multiple requests for multiple users.  Maybe something like:

require 'singleton'
class LocationFinder
   include singleton

   def locate(container, *args)
   end	
end

require 'singleton'
class LocationFinderQueue
  include singleton
  attr_accessor :container_queue 	
  def add_to_queue(container)
  end
  def remove_from_queue(container)
  end

end


REST:
  To make it fully RESTful, putaway clients should request to POST an assignment based on parameters.  
  Example:
	For a putaway assignment, a user provides the container as a parameter, and the url is a POST request to create a StorageAssignment.  Something like:
		http://server:3000/api/storage_assignment?container_id=123
	the URL is only accessible via a POST message to a method "create_storage_assignment" that creates the assignment with all the necessary logic behind it
	Likewise, picking into a container can be done via a GET request by getting all PickingAssingmnent records that exist for a given container:
		http://server:3000/api/picking_assignment/show?container_id=123
